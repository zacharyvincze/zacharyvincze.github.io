Welcome to my simple markdown formatting test.

<!--more-->

*This is just a simple Markdown formatting test*
**Bold typing**
Or normal typing, whatever works.

```c++
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    return 0;
    // Sometimes, I'll need to add really long lines of code when I get lazy. Because that's definitely something that should be normal. Right?
}
```
